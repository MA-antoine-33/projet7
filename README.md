# Project 7 from OpenClassRoom!

Create a **social media** for employees of **Groupomania**. It was created to facilitate interaction between coworker.
This is the first version, with some features, **create a account**, modify your profil, **add some publications** with or without a picture, like some publications...  
It was build in tow part :
	-First part : **Frontend**. I had to chose a framework for this part, and I chosed **React**, because currently, it's one of the powerfull framework, and it's easier to create style directly in JavaScript files.
	-Second part : **Backend**. I used **node js**, with the  framework **Express**,  and for the database I used **MongoDB** a NoSQL database.
